# Full Stack Open 2025 Exercises

This repository contains my solutions for the **Full Stack Open 2025** course by the University of Helsinki.  
It covers **all parts (0–8)** of the course, including frontend and backend development, state management, testing, databases, and GraphQL.

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate the concepts and exercises learned throughout the course, and to serve as a reference for building full-stack applications.

## Overview of Parts

### Part 0
Introduction to web development, Git, Node.js, and React basics.

### Part 1
React fundamentals including components, props, state, and basic interactivity.

### Part 2
Building React applications, working with REST APIs, and integrating external services (e.g., country information and weather data).

### Part 3
Backend development using Node.js and Express. CRUD operations, REST API design, and integration with a database (PostgreSQL instead of MongoDB).

### Part 4
Testing backend and frontend applications using unit and integration tests, including Jest and React Testing Library.

### Part 5
State management using Redux, connecting React components to a centralized store, and handling asynchronous actions.

### Part 6
Full backend applications with Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL. User authentication and CRUD operations for a blog application.

### Part 7
GraphQL APIs and Apollo Client/Server integration. Querying, mutations, and subscriptions.

### Part 8
Advanced frontend topics including performance optimization, caching, accessibility, and deployment considerations.

## Notes

- Backend parts use **PostgreSQL** instead of **MongoDB** to practice relational database concepts.  
- Some parts use databases or API keys; instructions for running those parts will be included inside their respective folders.  
- This repository demonstrates the full learning path of the course while showing practical full-stack development skills.
