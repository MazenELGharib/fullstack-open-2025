# Full Stack Open 2025 Exercises

This repository contains my solutions for the **Full Stack Open 2025** course by the University of Helsinki.  
It covers **all parts (0–8)** of the course, including frontend and backend development, state management, testing, databases, and GraphQL.

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate the concepts and exercises learned throughout the course, and to serve as a reference for building full-stack applications.
